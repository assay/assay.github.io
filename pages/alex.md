## EXPERIENCE

### Ericsson :: *Software Developer*
* * * * * * *
**2018 - present ::** *Stockholm, Sweden*\\
**Roles:** Software Developer, QA Prime, Agile coach\\
**Major achievements:**

* Relocator - a tool and a library to perform relocation of ”absolute” code
  (none-PIC) at load time (ELF, C++, autotools, bitbake, multiple platforms)
* LLD backend for Ericsson’s multi-core architecture (EMCA) instead of in-house linker (LLVM, C++)
* Lightweight OS (LPP) boot generator refactoring (Perl to Python) to improve maintainability, flexibility and testability
* Migration to Bazel build system (from in-house one) to improve performance and maintainability
* Documentation generator for Bazel-based build system (Python + Gatsby)
* Agile team process (Kanban, Retrospective, Backlog grooming, Daily standup) to increase productivity and transparency
* Product Quality evaluation (ISO 25000) to identify weak points and then improve product characteristics
* SDLC* process quality evaluation to identify weak points and then improve development processes
* CI/CD optimization to minimize processing time and increase testability
