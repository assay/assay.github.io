## Agenda

1. "Warm up" (or "Set the Stage") (5~10m)
2. Good/Bad (or Start/Stop/Continue) + Ideas etc (10~15m)
3. Action Plan (10~20m)

## What is Retrospective?

The main idea behind Retrospective is self-improvement of the Team (and things around the Team).
It is usually conducted when the Sprint ends but it does not much matter - we have no Sprints so we can do Retrospective at any time, of course it is good to do it regularly.
To simplify the things we can say that Retrospective highlights "good" and "bad" things doing by/happening with the Team:
 - "good" things to see and confirm the improvement
 - "bad" things to reveal and try to improve

So basically during Retrospective we should think and write down answers to the following 2 groups of questions:
1. What is good?
   * What is working well?
   * What we should continue doing?
   (e.g. using Jira, Morning meetings)
2. What is not good?
   * What is not working?
   * What should we try to change?
   * What is missing?
   * What should we stop doing?
   * What is blocking?
   (e.g. ToDo is not populated)

We can also add some variations and like:
- What was good but can be improved?
- What have I learned?
- What was hard to do?
- What is not clear? What still puzzles me?
- Do we have any new ideas? Interesting proposals?
etc.

Sometimes (in some Retrospective guidelines) questions can be arranged into 3 groups:

1. What should the team START doing?
2. What should the team STOP doing?
3. What should the team CONTINUE doing?

In fact it does not much matter - usually is still to identify "good" and "bad" things.

Then, after writing those things down and discussion, we can make an Action Plan
which is usually about how to improve identified "bad" things, start new activities etc.
It is also good practice to report items from Action Plan as issues in Jira.
