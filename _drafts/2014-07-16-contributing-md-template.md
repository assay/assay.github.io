### Welcome! Introduction

Thank you for your interest in contributing to BBI.
We want to make it as easy as possible to start contributing to BBI
and we hope this guide will help you get started.

### Code of Conduct

**Make decision**

1. Do you need CoC? (Probably you can skip it for small project)
2. Or should it be formal [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/)?
      Examples:
      - [Atom](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
      - [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/community/contribute/code-of-conduct/)
3. Maybe it better be informal CoC?
    (e.g. [Code of Ethics for Software Developers](https://medium.com/the-liberators/a-code-of-ethics-for-agile-software-developers-430b9a879be6) )

### Getting Help

If you need help or have questions check out the Developer Site
[Support](https://developer.internal.ericsson.com/docs/bbi/support/overview/) page.

> **TODO:**
> * How to contact BBI maintainers?
> * Mail? Chat (Teams)?

### Reporting Issues

One of the important ways to contribute is your feedback!
Reporting Bugs and proposing improvements or Feature Requests are always appreciated.
Please read [JIRA - for Issues](https://developer.internal.ericsson.com/docs/bbi/support/issues/) article

Here is direct link to [Jira: BBI](https://plf-jira.rnd.ki.sw.ericsson.se/projects/BBI/) issue tracker.

### Submitting Changes

The most valuable contribution is your direct participation in the BBI development process.
To become familiar with the BBI Source Code, the development Workflow
and to be ready to submit changes to the BBI you should read BBI
