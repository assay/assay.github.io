Modern commercial software (and hardware) development in most cases means
Open Source software development, both utilization and contribution,
which implies "Open Source rules":
culture, communication, methodologies, practices, processes, approaches,
guidelines, languages, libraries, tools, frameworks etc
(today we may say "Software = Open Source").

In fact we have no choice, we have to follow these "Open Source rules"
otherwise commercial companies will fail, just due to simple economical reasons.

Among many other aspects "Open Source rules" mean the following important principles:
1. Openness: source code, documents, plans etc should be open for all participants.
2. Transparency: most of the processes (better all!)  and contacts should be visible for all developers and customers.
3. Integrity: all dependencies between components should be explicit, all code should be buildable (from the source code!) and testable.
4. Open standards: preferably open and free standards and formats should be used.
5. FOSS: preferably Free Open Source Software tools, libraries, frameworks etc should be used.
6. Web: everything should be exposed via internet/intranet, all tools should have web-interface, all documents should be web-ready.
7. Cloud: development, communication and computation environments should be Cloud-ready (ready to be deployed as Cloud services, ready to use other Cloud services).
8. Collective ownership: anyone should be able to contribute ("Collective Code Ownership" expanded to all documents and other types of content).
9. Fast pace: study and use new technologies as earlier as possible, update to new versions quickly, get rid of legacies, utilize modern SW and HW, develop MWE (Minimal Working Example) ASAP, release often.

There are many more related principles, like:
10. Open communication: open communication channels should be used, all participants should be ready for open/public discussions, all discussions should be visible for everyone, everyone should be "open" for communication.
11. Freedom: developers and teams should be constrained as less as possible
12. Independence: always try to minimize dependencies, especially from commercial SW
13. Greater Interoperability: always aim to develop interoperable software (Linux, Windows, Mac etc)
14. Autonomy: software programs, libs, tools, components, services, frameworks etc should be developed/installed/configured to be running/used/tested with minimized dependencies from external components etc.
15. Higher Availability: software (service etc) should be always available for users (customers)
16. Maintainability
17. Self-organization
18. Simplicity

etc
we should also consider.

Yes, all of these things are just common principles for Modern Software Development
but in fact all of them were forged by Open Source communities.
