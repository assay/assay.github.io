Considering big (more than 50 members) Software Development projects the organization structure is important.
Modern projects usually have two important teams: Product Management team and Software Architecture team.
Here are Responsibilities for these teams and Requirements to their members.

## Product Management team

Why `Product` - the main focus is The Product

Why `Management` - [Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management)
here mostly means [Software project management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_project_management)
including leading, planning, execution, monitoring and control.

Why `team` - for big projects one Product Manaer is not enough.

### Responsibilities:

- Set the Product Vision and Strategy
- Define Product hierarchy and Functional module structure and Product Deliverables
- Develop and keep updated Product development Roadmap
taking into account all technical and business aspects, including:
  ** Requirement Management
  ** Risk Management
  ** Resource Management
  ** Release Management
  etc
- Monitor and control Feature Development and Product Releases (via Product Owners of Development Teams)
- Customer negotiation and Customer satisfaction

### Basic operation principles:

- A number of Product Management team members is 5-7
- Product Management team should operate as an ordinary Agile team (SM, PO, Planning, Grooming, Retrospective etc)
- The members of Development teams can be promoted to Product Management team
if they satisfy requirements (see below)
- The goals of Product Management team must be prioritized among other activities
- Product Management team involves Software Architecture team in the development of the Software Architecture and Module Structure (directly or via PO of the Software Architecture team)
- Product Management team monitors and controls Feature Development and Product Releases (via POs of Development teams)
- Product Management team organizes Cross-Functional and Cross-Domain teams
- Product Owner in the Product Management team represents the Customer(s) and/or the Stakeholder(s) 

### Requirements:

- Excellent communication, presentation and negotiation skills
- Exceptional organizational and administrative skills
- Expert knowledge in domain area
- Experience in Project Management
- Knowledge of Software Development processes, SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)
- Good understanding of Feature Development and Release Management

## Software Architecture team

Why `Software` - the main focus of the team should be on +Software Development aspects+ of the BBI,
while Domain area and Product roadmap should define functional goals for the BBI.

Why `Architecture` - the team is responsible for all +architectural and structural changes+ of the BBI.

Why `team` - for big project one [Software Architect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_architect)
role is not enough, Architects team should be able to solve different usually rather complex technical problems.

### Responsibilities:

- Define Software Architecture and Module Structure
- Define which Software Development technologies, tools and platforms
- Plan, lead and perform major structural changes to ensure future development
- Develop and enforce common Coding conventions, Design rules and Best Practices
- Gradually improve Software Development processes to speed-up Feature development and increase Code and Product Quality

### Basic operation principles:

- A number of Software Architecture team members is 5-7
- Software Architecture team should operate as an ordinary Agile team (SM, PO, Planning, Grooming, Retrospective etc)
- The members of Development teams can be promoted to Software Architecture team
  if they satisfy requirements (see below)
- The goals of Software Architecture team must be prioritized among other activities
- Software Architecture team must provide the possibility for Product Management team
  to fulfill short- and long-term product development goals
- Product Owner in the Software Architecture team represents Product Management team

### Requirements:

- Exceptional programming skills with several modern programming languages (including C/C++, Python, Java, JavaScript)
- Experience with large Software Projects
- Experience with Project Management
- Expertise in Software Architecture and Design
- Expertise in Software Development Best Practices
- Good understanding of SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)
- Good knowledge of modern Software Development methodologies
- Good communication skills
- Some knowledge of BB architecture and project structure
- Good to have experience with Open Source projects
